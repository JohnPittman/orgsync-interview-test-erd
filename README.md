We have an application that we want to improve by providing the users with a way to create
events. Users should be able to create an event, invite people, and receive an RSVP.
Provide an ERD showing the new database tables/fields necessary to implement this
feature. Then, briefly describe how your model handles recurring events including the
positives and negatives of your approach.

Assumptions:

 - No code.
 - Basic recurring intervals vs special cases ex. "last Thursday of every other month."
 - Basic tables to prove concept vs entire application ex. message handling and notifications.
